My poorly written ls clone to help me learn rust

Not intented to replace ls by any means unless you want a buggy mess of a program


My goals are a very basic, working implementation of ls in rust and then maybe doing some rewrites 
to make it leaner and more suitable as a day-to-day replacement of ls. 


If you want a real ls clone check out "exa" it's much more feature rich and is probably a lot faster too
